# Statistical Epidemiology Project Repository

The objectives, methods, results, and conclusions of the project are mentioned in the final report PDF file. The Project Data compressed archive contains all the data mined for the project. The R script contains the code used for Spatial Regression.

## Additional Work
I had also done a survey on neck, back and joints' health and analysed the results. The results of this assignment are showcased in a PDF file located in this repository.
